- `src/app/api/analytics/*` - Public analytics API endpoints
- `src/app/api/admin/analytics/*` - Admin-only analytics API endpoints
- `src/lib/adminAuth.ts` - Admin authentication middleware

### Frontend Components
- `src/components/AnalyticsBeacon.tsx` - Client-side tracking script
- `src/app/admin/analytics/page.tsx` - Admin analytics dashboard
- `src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated admin dashboard with analytics link

### Data Storage
- **Format**: JSON flat files organized by date
- **Location**: `data/sessions/` directory
- **Structure**: `sessions_YYYY-MM-DD.json` files
- **Retention**: Configurable (default: 30 days)
- **Cleanup**: Automated old file removal

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env.local` file contains the required admin credentials:

```bash
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

### 2. File Permissions
The system requires write access to the `data/sessions/` directory:

```bash
# Create data directory
mkdir -p data/sessions

# Set appropriate permissions (Linux/Mac)
chmod 755 data/sessions

# Windows: Ensure the application has write access to the directory
```

### 3. Clerk Integration
The analytics system integrates with Clerk for user authentication:

- User IDs are automatically captured when users are logged in
- Guest sessions are tracked with anonymous identifiers
- Authentication status is recorded for each session

### 4. Server Configuration
Ensure your Next.js application has the necessary middleware configured:

- Rate limiting middleware is active
- Admin authentication is properly configured
- CORS settings allow analytics API calls

## Usage Guide
